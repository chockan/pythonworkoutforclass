 **Authors** : *Fernando Perez, Emmanuelle Gouillart, Gaël Varoquaux, Valentin Haenel*

## 1.1.1. Why Python?

### 1.1.1.1. The scientist’s needs

* Get data (simulation, experiment control),
* Manipulate and process data,
* Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality figures, for reports or publications.

### 1.1.1.2. Python’s strengths

* **Batteries included** Rich collection of already existing **bricks** of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!
* **Easy to learn** Most scientists are not paid as programmers, neither have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.
* **Easy communication** To keep code alive within a lab or a company it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.
* **Efficient code** Python numerical modules are computationally efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.
* **Universal** Python is a language used for many different problems. Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.

### 1.1.1.3. How does Python compare to other solutions?

#### Compiled languages: C, C++, Fortran…

Pros**:*** Very fast. For heavy computations, it’s difficult to outperform these languages.

Cons**:*** Painful usage: no interactivity during development, mandatory compilation steps, verbose syntax, manual memory management. These are **difficult languages** for non programmers.

#### Matlab scripting language

Pros**:*** Very rich collection of libraries with numerous algorithms, for many different domains. Fast execution because these libraries are often written in a compiled language.

* Pleasant development environment: comprehensive and help, integrated editor, etc.
* Commercial support is available.

Cons**:*** Base language is quite poor and can become restrictive for advanced users.

* Not free and not everything is open sourced.

#### Julia

Pros**:*** Fast code, yet interactive and simple.

* Easily connects to Python or C.

Cons**:*** Ecosystem limited to numerical computing.

* Still young.

#### Other scripting languages: Scilab, Octave, R, IDL, etc.

Pros**:*** Open-source, free, or at least cheaper than Matlab.

* Some features can be very advanced (statistics in R, etc.)

Cons**:*** Fewer available algorithms than in Matlab, and the language is not more advanced.

* Some software are dedicated to one domain. Ex: Gnuplot to draw curves. These programs are very powerful, but they are restricted to a single type of usage, such as plotting.

#### Python

Pros**:*** Very rich scientific computing libraries

* Well thought out language, allowing to write very readable and well structured code: we “code what we think”.
* Many libraries beyond scientific computing (web server, serial port access, etc.)
* Free and open-source software, widely spread, with a vibrant community.
* A variety of powerful environments to work in, such as [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

Cons**:*** Not all the algorithms that can be found in more specialized software or toolboxes.

## 1.1.2. The scientific Python ecosystem

Unlike Matlab, or R, Python does not come with a pre-bundled set of modules for scientific computing. Below are the basic building blocks that can be combined to obtain a scientific computing environment:

 **Python** , a generic and modern computing language

* The language: flow control, data types (`<span class="pre">string</span>`, `<span class="pre">int</span>`), data collections (lists, dictionaries), etc.
* Modules of the standard library: string processing, file management, simple network protocols.
* A large number of specialized modules or applications written in Python: web framework, etc. … and scientific computing.
* Development tools (automatic testing, documentation generation)

## 1.1.3. Before starting: Installing a working environment

Python comes in many flavors, and there are many ways to install it. However, we recommend to install a scientific-computing distribution, that comes readily with optimized versions of scientific modules.

**Under Linux**

If you have a recent distribution, most of the tools are probably packaged, and it is recommended to use your package manager.

**Other systems**

There are several fully-featured scientific Python distributions:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/)

## 1.1.4. The workflow: interactive environments and text editors

**Interactive work to test and understand algorithms:** In this section, we describe a workflow combining interactive work and consolidation.

Python is a general-purpose language. As such, there is not one blessed environment to work in, and not only one way of using it. Although this makes it harder for beginners to find their way, it makes it possible for Python to be used for programs, in web servers, or embedded devices.

### 1.1.4.1. Interactive work

We recommend an interactive work with the [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console, or its offspring, the [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/content-quickstart.html). They are handy to explore and understand algorithms.

Under the notebook

To execute code, press “shift enter”

Start ipython:

```
In [1]: print('Hello world')
Hello world
```

Getting help by using the **?** operator after an object:

```
In [2]: print?
Signature: print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
Docstring:
Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.

sep
  string inserted between values, default a space.
end
  string appended after the last value, default a newline.
file
  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
flush
  whether to forcibly flush the stream.
Type:      builtin_function_or_method
```

### 1.1.4.2. Elaboration of the work in an editor

As you move forward, it will be important to not only work interactively, but also to create and reuse Python files. For this, a powerful code editor will get you far. Here are several good easy-to-use editors:

> * [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/): integrates an IPython console, a debugger, a profiler…
> * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm): integrates an IPython console, notebooks, a debugger… (freely available, but commercial)
> * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python): integrates a Python console, notebooks, a debugger, …

Some of these are shipped by the various scientific Python distributions, and you can find them in the menus.

As an exercise, create a file my_file.py in a code editor, and add the following lines:

```
s = 'Hello world'
print(s)
```

Now, you can run it in IPython console or a notebook and explore the resulting variables:

```
In [3]: %run my_file.py
Hello world

In [4]: s
Out[4]: 'Hello world'

In [5]: %whos
Variable   Type    Data/Info
----------------------------
s          str     Hello world
```

**From a script to functions**

While it is tempting to work only with scripts, that is a file full of instructions following each other, do plan to progressively evolve the script to a set of functions:

* A script is not reusable, functions are.
* Thinking in terms of functions helps breaking the problem in small blocks.

### 1.1.4.3. IPython and Jupyter Tips and Tricks

The user manuals contain a wealth of information. Here we give a quick introduction to four useful features:  *history* ,  *tab completion* ,  *magic functions* , and  *aliases* .

**Command history** Like a UNIX shell, the IPython console supports command history. Type *up* and *down* to navigate previously typed commands:

```
In [6]: x = 10

In [7]: <UP>

In [8]: x = 10
```

**Tab completion** Tab completion, is a convenient way to explore the structure of any object you’re dealing with. Simply type object_name.`<TAB>` to view the object’s attributes. Besides Python objects and keywords, tab completion also works on file and directory names.*

```
In [9]: x = 10

In [10]: x.<TAB>
          as_integer_ratio() conjugate()        imag               to_bytes()
          bit_count()        denominator        numerator
          bit_length()       from_bytes()       real
```

**Magic functions** The console and the notebooks support so-called *magic* functions by prefixing a command with the `<span class="pre">%</span>` character. For example, the `<span class="pre">run</span>` and `<span class="pre">whos</span>` functions from the previous section are magic functions. Note that, the setting `<span class="pre">automagic</span>`, which is enabled by default, allows you to omit the preceding `<span class="pre">%</span>` sign. Thus, you can just type the magic function and it will work.

Other useful magic functions are:

* `<span class="pre">%cd</span>` to change the current directory.

  ```
  In [11]: cd /tmp
  /tmp
  ```
* `<span class="pre">%cpaste</span>` allows you to paste code, especially code from websites which has been prefixed with the standard Python prompt (e.g. `<span class="pre">>>></span>`) or with an ipython prompt, (e.g. `<span class="pre">in</span><span> </span><span class="pre">[3]</span>`):

  ```
  In [12]: %cpaste
  ```
* `<span class="pre">%timeit</span>` allows you to time the execution of short snippets using the `<span class="pre">timeit</span>` module from the standard library:

  ```
  In [12]: %timeit x = 10
  8.81 ns +- 0.187 ns per loop (mean +- std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000,000 loops each)
  ```

  [Chapter on optimizing code](https://lectures.scientific-python.org/advanced/optimizing/index.html#optimizing-code-chapter)
* `<span class="pre">%debug</span>` allows you to enter post-mortem debugging. That is to say, if the code you try to execute, raises an exception, using `<span class="pre">%debug</span>` will enter the debugger at the point where the exception was thrown.

  ```

**Aliases** Furthermore IPython ships with various *aliases* which emulate common UNIX command line tools such as `<span class="pre">ls</span>` to list files, `<span class="pre">cp</span>` to copy files and `<span class="pre">rm</span>` to remove files (a full list of aliases is shown when typing `<span class="pre">alias</span>`).
