two machines over a network. With sockets, you can establish connections, send and receive data, and handle various 
network protocols like TCP/IP and UDP.

bind(): Associates the socket to a specific address and port.
listen(): Starts listening for incoming connections on the socket.
accept(): Accepts a connection from a client and returns a new socket for communication.
connect(): Establishes a connection to a remote server.
send(): Sends data through the socket.
recv(): Receives data from the socket.
close(): Closes the socket connection.
